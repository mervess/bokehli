This is an umbrella project that will host a couple of data analysis and science projects underneath.

All has one in common, _bokeh_, a lovely jubbly, interactive data visualisation library.

*The name **bokeh~li** has two meanings:
1) In Swiss-German, the language of where I live, it means "little bokeh". 
2) In Turkish, my mother tongue, it means "including bokeh".

Both serve their purposes in this project ‚ô°

Current data projects undergoing:
1) Newborn data ‚û°Ô∏è involves statistical data analysis
2) Customer/purchase data ‚û°Ô∏è involves statistical data analysis + future purchase prediction via machine learning

The data handling libraries included in the projects are as follows.

Visualisation:

- [bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) _(obviously.)_
- [holoviews](https://github.com/holoviz/holoviews) _(make bokeh fly!üéà)_

Data science:

- [pyspark](https://github.com/apache/spark) _(**spark** the distributed computing!‚ú® Even if the data is not that "big", there are times I prefer SQL over code, hence spark.)_
- [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) üêº
